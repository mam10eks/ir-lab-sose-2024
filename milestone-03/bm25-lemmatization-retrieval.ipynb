Despite its global impact, there still remain a number of open questions related to better understanding of tourists and their habits. In this work we analyze the largest data set of travel receipts considered thus far, and focus on exploring and modeling booking behavior of online customers. We extract useful, actionable insights into the booking behavior, and tackle the task of predicting the booking time. The presented results can be directly used to improve booking experience of customers and optimize targeting campaigns of travel operators.</td>\n",

       "0  Travel the World: Analyzing and Predicting Booking Behavior using E-mail Travel Receipts\\n\\n\\n ABSTRACTTourism industry has grown tremendously in the previous several decades. Despite its global impact, there still remain a number of open questions related to better understanding of tourists and their habits. In this work we analyze the largest data set of travel receipts considered thus far, and focus on exploring and modeling booking behavior of online customers. We extract useful, actionable insights into the booking behavior, and tackle the task of predicting the booking time. The presented results can be directly used to improve booking experience of customers and optimize targeting campaigns of travel operators.  \n",

The search result quality factors we use are average booking position and distribution of margin in topranked results. (We expect that total revenue will increase with these factors.) Our application of the SVMRank technique improves booking position by up to 25% and margin distribution by up to 14%.  \n",

For example, users have determined the departure, the destination, and the travel time for booking a flight. However, in many scenarios, limited by experience and knowledge, users may know what they need, but still struggle to figure out clear and specific goals by determining all the necessary slots. * Equal contribution. † Mainly responsible for dataset collection during his internship at Baidu.
